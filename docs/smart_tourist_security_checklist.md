## Important MVP Security Notes

1. **Simplified Architecture**: MVP uses Firebase extensively, reducing complexity but requiring proper Firebase security configuration.

2. **No Blockchain**: MVP doesn't include blockchain, so traditional database security and audit logging become more critical.

3. **Basic Features**: Focus on securing core functionality (registration, SOS, basic monitoring) rather than advanced features.

4. **Rapid Development**: Balance security with development speed, but never compromise on critical security controls.

5. **Future Scalability**: Implement security measures that won't hinder scaling to the full production system.

This MVP checklist focuses on essential security controls needed for a functional and secure minimum viable product while maintaining development agility.
